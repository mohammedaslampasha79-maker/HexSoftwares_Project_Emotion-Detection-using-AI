# HexSoftwares_Project_Emotion-Detection-using-AI
Emotion Detection System using AI that detects human emotions from text, speech, and facial expressions using Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision. The project supports emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, and Neutral and demonstrates real-world AI applications.
Emotion Detection using Artificial Intelligence is a machine learning–based project that identifies human emotions from text, with speech and facial emotion detection included as extensions.
This project demonstrates how AI can understand emotional states and support real-world applications.

# Project Overview

The system uses Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze input data and predict emotions such as:
Happy
Sad
Angry
Fear
Surprise
Neutral
The main implementation focuses on text-based emotion detection, while speech and facial emotion detection are implemented as prototype demos.
